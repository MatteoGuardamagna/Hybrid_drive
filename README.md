This repository contains the following:

* **Parts**: A list of parts needed to build the drive. Including [flexDrive](https://github.com/open-ephys/flexDrive) git repositories for the drive body and the screw-spring mechanism.
* **Building instructions**: a step-by-step [guide](docs/hd_building_instructions.pdf) on how to build the drive.
* **Implant instructions**: a quick [guide](docs/implant_procedure.pdf) on how to carry out an implant procedure witht the Hybrid drive.
* **Array design**: a [repository](https://github.com/MatteoGuardamagna/Hybrid_drive/tree/main/docs/array_design) with all tested implant designs. 
* **Videos and images**: A collection of [images](https://github.com/MatteoGuardamagna/Hybrid_drive/tree/main/images) and [videos](https://github.com/MatteoGuardamagna/Hybrid_drive/tree/main/videos) of the hybrid drive, before and after the implant procedure.

## Scientific aproach

Many brain areas, including the cortex and the hippocampus, are organized in local circuits and laminar structure, with information processing within and across layers. Simultaneously measuring neural activity across these two dimensions, while an animal is freely interacting with its environment, remains a key challenge in modern neuroscience. We aim to tackle this challenge with the Hybrid Drive, combining in a single device the flexibility of tetrode arrays with the spatial coverage of silicon probes. This microdrive enables novel insights on how the input balance from different layers influences the spiking activity of large neural populations, in freely moving mice.

## Contribute

Different area-specific arrays are present in the repository [array_design](https://github.com/MatteoGuardamagna/Hybrid_drive/tree/main/docs/array_design). Create *pull requests* to contribute with new or improved designs.

The silicon probes and the EIB desgin can be adapted as well, according to experimental demands. We actively collaborate with [ATLAS Neuro](https://www.atlasneuro.com/) to develop new combinations. Feel free to contact me at guardamagnamatteo@gmail.com
