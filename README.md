This repository contains the following:

* **Parts**: A list of parts needed to build the drive. Including [FlexDrive](https://github.com/open-ephys/flexDrive) git repositories for the drive body and the screw-spring mechanism.
* **Building instructions**: a step-by-step guide on how to build the drive. 
* **Videos and images**
* **Code**

## News
- xxx the preprint of the drive is out on [biorxiv] ()

## Contribute

Multiple area-specific arrays are present in the repository [array_design](https://github.com/MatteoGuardamagna/Hybrid_drive/tree/main/docs/array_design). Create *pull requests* to contribute with new or improved designs.

The silicon probes and the EIB desgin can also be adapted, according to experimental demands. We actively collaborate with [ATLAS Neuro](https://www.atlasneuro.com/) to develop new combinations. Feel free to contact me at guardamagnamatteo@gmail.com
